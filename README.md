Project: Comprehensive Coin Market Data Aggregation System

API Insider

Role: The API insider is responsible for gathering data from official cryptocurrency exchanges and market platforms. It fetches detailed information such as coin prices, trading volumes, market caps, and other relevant metrics.
Functionality: This component periodically sends requests to various cryptocurrency exchangesâ€™ APIs, retrieves the latest market data, and formats it into a standardized structure for consistency.
API Receiver

Role: The API receiver acts as the initial point of contact for external data requests from users or other systems.
Functionality: It handles incoming API calls, validates them, and ensures that the requests are properly authenticated. The API receiver then fetches the required data from the database or forwards the request to other internal components if needed.
Web Insider

Role: The Web insider collects data from web pages that are not accessible via APIs but contain valuable market information such as news articles, market sentiment, and analyst predictions.
Functionality: Using web scraping techniques, the Web insider scans and extracts relevant data from various cryptocurrency news sites, forums, and blogs. It processes the data to ensure it is clean, structured, and ready for analysis.
Broker Service

Role: The Broker service acts as an intermediary between the data collection components (API insider, Web insider, and crawler) and the end-users or client applications.
Functionality: It consolidates the data from different sources, ensures data integrity, and provides a unified interface for accessing the data. The Broker service handles data caching, rate limiting, and response formatting to optimize performance and user experience.
Crawler

Role: The crawler continuously navigates the web to discover new sources of cryptocurrency market data and updates from existing ones.
Functionality: It automatically scans websites at regular intervals, detects any changes or new content, and fetches this information. The crawler ensures that the data repository remains up-to-date with the latest market trends, coin listings, and regulatory news.
Workflow
Data Collection: The API insider and Web insider gather data from their respective sources. The crawler enhances this by discovering additional data points.
Data Processing: The collected data is cleaned, standardized, and stored in the central database.
Data Access: Users and client applications send requests to the API receiver, which forwards them to the Broker service.
Data Delivery: The Broker service fetches the required data, applies any necessary transformations, and sends it back to the API receiver, which then delivers it to the requester.
